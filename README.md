# Dari
Agentic AI-powered navigation reasoning system using LLMs and geospatial data.
Daari (Kannada: route/path) is an AI-powered navigation reasoning system that uses
agentic AI and advanced retrieval-augmented generation to interpret geospatial routes
and provide human-friendly, context-aware directions.

## Vision
Traditional navigation systems provide routes.
Daari explains, reasons, and adapts routes using AI agents.

## Key Concepts
- Agentic AI (planner–executor pattern)
- Advanced RAG over structured geospatial data
- LLM reasoning over routes and constraints
- Production-ready MLOps and CI/CD

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python, FastAPI
- AI: LLMs, agent-based orchestration
- Frontend: React Native (TypeScript)
- Infra: Docker, GitHub Actions
- Deployment: Free-tier cloud services

## Status
🚧 In active development
